Book suggestions for undergrad/master students
 </p>
Suppose you already learnt some abstract algebra (rings, ideals, modules etc.):
 </p>
1. You should learn Galois theory. I recommend Hungerford's book ``Algebra" Chapter V (try to solve most of the exercises there).
 </p>

2. More algebraic preparations: 
Learn some language of categories, e.g., Hungerford's book ``Algebra" Chapter X.
<br />
Learn some commutative algebra. Standard book: Atiyah-Macdonald ``Introduction to Commutative Algebra" (try to solve most of the exercises there).
<br />
Learn some homological algebra. For example, Hilton-Stambach: ``A Course in Homological Algebra", Chapter 1-4. (some of Chapter 5, 6 if you like).
 </p>

3. Venturing into AG and NT.
For AG, can start with Hartshorne ``Algebraic Geometry" Chapter 1-3.
 <br />
For NT, Local class field theory, Serre: ``Local fields".   Global CFT, Neukirch book; and/or Cassels-Frohlich book.
<br />
With some AG learnt, can learn Elliptic curves. Silverman, ``The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves".
<br />
Relation between EC and MF, Diamond-Shurman, ``A First Course in Modular Forms".
